## Adapting next to express

This is an example repo of an application created with a common stack (React/Express). Special thanks to Nathalie Bennaroch ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/Nathalieben26), [Github](https://github.com/NATHALIEBENARROCH/.)) for providing this repo!

## Original stack:

The original stack is shown on [this branch](https://github.com/lavilabs/adapting-express-to-next/tree/original). It was the classical Create-React-app with an express backend.

## Goal

The goal of this repo is to show a before/after of how to adapt a Repository to be hosted on Vercel.
